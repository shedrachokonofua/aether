# Snapshot Strategy:
# - NVME: Hourly-only (12h retention) for instant rollback. PBS covers daily/weekly/monthly.
# - HDD/VM: Daily-only (7d retention). PBS covers longer retention.
# - HDD/Data: Daily with long retention. Media is write-once, minimal snapshot overhead.
# - HDD/Backups-Data: Minimal retention. It's a backup of backups.
# - HDD/Backups-VM: Disabled. PBS handles its own versioning.
